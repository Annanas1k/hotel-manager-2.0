# John Holdings Hotel Website

## Overview

Welcome to the John Holdings Hotel Website, my first Angular project and a personal learning journey in web development. This project represents a hotel website where I've applied fundamental concepts, including page routing, connecting to a Java backend server, fetching and displaying data from a database, implementing admin login functionality, and creating other pages to simulate a realistic hotel site.

## Colaborator

BackEnd Developer - https://github.com/LunguIon/HotelManager.git

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** The frontend of the website is built using Angular, a powerful JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.

- **Java Spring:** The backend server is developed with Java Spring, providing RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and the database.

- **Database:** The application interacts with a database to store and retrieve data for dynamic content on the website.

## Key Features

1. **Page Routing:**
  - Implemented page routing to navigate seamlessly between different sections of the website.

2. **Integration with Java Backend:**
  - Connected the Angular frontend to a Java Spring backend server, ensuring smooth communication.

3. **Data Retrieval and Display:**
  - Utilized Angular services to fetch and display dynamic content from the database.

4. **Admin Login Functionality:**
  - Implemented a secure admin login system to access privileged areas of the site.

5. **Realistic Page Structure:**
  - Created additional pages to simulate a comprehensive hotel website, including booking, about, and gallery pages.

## Note

This project is part of my ongoing learning process, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own learning journey.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
